## Sutta Nipāta by Laurence Mills

The Sutta Nipāta is a well known and well loved early Buddhist text. It is a compilation of poems that inspire, educate, and admonish.

The primary translator and commentator is the experienced Pali scholar Laurence Khantipalo Mills, with portions by others including Bhikkhu Ñānamoli and Bhikkhu Sujato. Download the PDF (0.8mb) here or you can order the paperback on Lulu.com.
